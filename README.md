# How the System Runs

**User Login:**

Upon launching the system, users are prompted to enter their username and password to log into their bank account.

**Dashboard:**

After successful login, the user is taken to their account dashboard, where they can view:

- Current balance.


- Transaction history.


- User details.


**Performing Transactions:**


Users can choose from three primary transactions:


- Deposit: Add funds to the account.


- Withdraw: Remove funds from the account.


- Transfer: Move funds between accounts.


Each transaction is recorded and logged with a receipt showing transaction details.


**Fraud Detection:**


Each transaction is analyzed in real-time using the Isolation Forest algorithm.


The system automatically checks for anomalies, such as:


-Unusual transaction amounts.


-Transactions at uncommon times.


-Frequent transactions within a short period.


If any suspicious activity is detected, the system alerts the user immediately.


**Transaction Logs:**


All transactions are saved and can be accessed in the transaction history section for auditing or review.
